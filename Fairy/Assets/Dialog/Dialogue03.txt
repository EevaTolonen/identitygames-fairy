Troll: "See, little thing. A robber's roast I was making, from real robbers, no less, when Redcaps, the little nuisances, stole my spicebox! I made pursuit, as any troll would after such offense, but the infernal miscreants made their way to their den. With a bulk such as mine, I cannot give chase futher.. but thee could, little thing. Retrive what is mine, and on a troll's troth, this one will open the way."
